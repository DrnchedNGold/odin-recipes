        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (4 ounce) tilapia fillets</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season both sides of each fillet with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press each fillet into the flour to coat and shake off any excess.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tilapia fillets in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Brush melted butter onto the tilapia fillets in the last minute before removing from the skillet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drizzle fillets with lemon juice and garnish with parsley and thyme.
            </li>
        </ol>
